# JavaScript30

This repo consists of JavaScript tasks created by Wes Bos (https://javascript30.com).
I'm going to try to add a new one every single day, more or less ;)
The idea is to solve tasks using just vanilla JS - no bundlers, no frameworks, etc.
I'm hoping to be consistent and accomplish the challenge by completing all 30 tasks.
Good luck to me!
